            <p>
                The disparities in regional budget allocation in the Philippines have widened over the years leading to an increasing imbalance in resources. This steady growth of inequality has resulted in significant gaps in funding, with some regions receiving substantially less support despite having greater needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Budget allocation across regions in the Philippines remains highly unequal. In 2018, the Davao Region saw an increase in funding during President Duterte's Term, while two other regions suffered budget cuts<a href="https://www.abs-cbn.com/focus/09/05/18/davao-region-most-favored-others-get-cuts-token-hike-in-infra-budgets" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This pattern of disparity continued in 2024, with CPBRD reporting that some of the poorest regions such as Zamboanga, Bangsamoro, and parts of Mindanao received less than 1% of the DOTr's P 181 million budget, while 85% was concentrated in Metro Manila (NCR)<a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2024/09/03/2382374/poorest-regions-left-out-transport-projects-study" target="_blank">[2]</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Evidently, for over three decades, underinvestment as reported by EDCOM in 1991 has contributed to a steady decline in education quality here in the Philippines. Although Senator Gatchalian noted that DepED consistently receives the highest budget allocation, distribution remains uneven<a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/912755/the-cost-of-miseducation-lack-of-investment-in-ph-education-sector/story/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.

        <p>
            In this project, we will use data science to analyze the budget allocation of various government departments in the Philippines. Through this, we aim to find potential inequalities or potential biases in the said budget at the regional level. In addition, we aim to establish correlations, should they exist, between the allocations and several key indicators such as population, poverty, and GDP.

                <p>
                    The data set is a mix of different data sheets all grouped per region or province including but not limited to the budget allocations per department, crop and fishery production, enrollment data, population, poverty incidence, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All regional and provincial officesâ€™ budgets were collected apart from the BARMM. This is because of the relatively new Bangsamoro Organic Law which provides fiscal autonomy to the region. The law provides BARMM with the powers to allocate their own budgets and limitedly tax people within their own territory. Hence it is hard to measure the inequality with the budget of BARMM in relation with the other executive departments. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For each department, their budget allocations will be grouped by Region (excluding BARMM). Given a time span of 2020-2024, we have a total of 17 Departments * 16 Regions * 5 Years = 1360 Observations.

            <p>
                Data regarding the budget allocations and specific projects of the DPWH was gathered from the documents and files publicly released by the Department of Budget and Management. Only the years 2020-2024 were collected as they were the only ones with available Excel files of the General Appropriations Act, the law passed by Congress each year which provided specific details on the budgets of each government agency for that year. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Data regarding crops, fisheries, and farmland, which was gathered to correlate with the Department of Agriculture and Department of Agrarian Reform, was gathered from OpenStat PSA website.
            </p>                    
            <p>
                Data regarding the enrollment data of DepED was found from a multitude of sources. Certain years were provided by DepED itself in its website, meanwhile others were taken from images DepED provided to news outlets, and others were taken from posts made by the official DepED account on Facebook. 
            </p>                    
            <p>
                Data regarding population was gathered from the Projected Mid-Year Population from the PSA website.
            </p> 
            <p>                    
                Data regarding the annual per capita poverty threshold and poverty incidence was gathered from the 2023 Full Year Official Poverty Statistics Tables from the PSA website. Only the years 2018, 2021, and 2023 were collected as they were the only ones available in the Excel file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data regarding GDP was gathered from the PSA and OpenStat PSA websites. For the Regional Data, only the years 2020-2023 are available. For the Province/HUC breakdown, only the years 2021-2023 are available.
