            <h1>Unequal budget distribution across regions in the Philippines dampens regional growth</h1>
            <p>
                The disparities in regional budget allocation in the Philippines have widened over the years leading to an increasing imbalance in resources. This steady growth of inequality has resulted in significant gaps in funding, with some regions receiving substantially less support despite having greater needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Budget allocation across regions in the Philippines remains highly unequal. In 2018, the Davao Region saw an increase in funding during President Duterte's Term, while two other regions suffered budget cuts<a href="https://www.abs-cbn.com/focus/09/05/18/davao-region-most-favored-others-get-cuts-token-hike-in-infra-budgets" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This pattern of disparity continued in 2024, with CPBRD reporting that some of the poorest regions such as Zamboanga, Bangsamoro, and parts of Mindanao received less than 1% of the DOTr's P 181 million budget, while 85% was concentrated in Metro Manila (NCR)<a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2024/09/03/2382374/poorest-regions-left-out-transport-projects-study" target="_blank">[2]</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Evidently, for over three decades, underinvestment as reported by EDCOM in 1991 has contributed to a steady decline in education quality here in the Philippines. Although Senator Gatchalian noted that DepED consistently receives the highest budget allocation, distribution remains uneven<a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/912755/the-cost-of-miseducation-lack-of-investment-in-ph-education-sector/story/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.

            In this project, we will use data science to analyze the budget allocation of various government departments in the Philippines. Through this, we aim to find potential inequalities or potential biases in the said budget at the regional level. In addition, we aim to establish correlations, should they exist, between the allocations and several key indicators such as population, poverty, and GDP.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">Department of Agriculture</span> has regional offices and regional field units. These would be added together based on their regions. Additional allocations such as to the Bureaus of Agricultural Research, Animal Industry, and Fish Industry would be disregarded as they are presumed to be national bureaus catering to the entire national need. There is also a considerable allocation towards the Central Office and blank agencies. These allocations are primarily for national agricultural programs such as the Swine Industry Recovery Project, Agro-Industry Modernization Credit and Financing Program and the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Program. The specific budgeting and regional allocation for each program listed is not provided in the budget or the General Appropriations Act, hence the budget towards the Central Office and blank agencies is presumed to also be national and disregarded.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">Department of Agrarian Reform</span> handles 81 provincial offices (PARO). The regional offices are also provided with budget allocations. There are 2 approaches to this data. Either the provincial offices are added based on their respective regions and added with the regional office budgets, or the regional office’s budget is split amongst its provinces or just disregarded. Further consultation would determine the approach taken towards this data.
                                </p>

                                    Furthermore, just like the Department of Agriculture, there is a considerable amount of the budget allocated to the Central Office, which is not affiliated with any region. This amount is not allocated to any national program like in the DA, but is rather more associated with the salaries and benefits of the employees in the DAR’s Office of the Secretary.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">Department of Environment and Natural Resources</span> has around 76 Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Offices (PENRO) across the country. Each of these have their own respective budgets. Apart from the PENRO’s, there are also regional offices which are weirdly split into “Regional Office” and “Regional Office - Proper”. Further consultation would determine the approach taken towards this, whether it would be focused on the regions or provinces. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are also other bureaus within the DENR such as the Land Management Bureau, Biodiversity Management Bureau and the Forest Management Bureau. These bureaus’ services are spread throughout the country and are not able to be divided into regions or provinces, hence their budget allocations will be disregarded.
                                </p>    
                                <p>                                    
                                    Just like every other department in the Philippines, there is a considerable amount allocated to the Central Office, which has no regional affiliation. The amounts allocated to the Central Office and blank agencies are primarily for capital outlays of sewer systems, buildings, ICT software and reforestation programs. There are also amounts allocated to maintenance and personnel, however these allocations do not give details where these programs are being taken place or spent on, hence they cannot be divided into regions which are important for the study. Hence the budgets allocated to the Central Office and blank agencies will be disregarded as they are not able to be broken down into specific regions to find any inequalities.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">Department of Education</span> handles around 9400 public schools nationwide. This number changes per year as new schools open and old schools close. There is also the issue of schools changing their names which could be hard to keep track of. The Department of Education also does not publicly release the number of students per public school. They do however provide the number of enrollees per region. Due to this limitation, gathering any meaningful conclusions would require grouping the 9400 schools into their respective regions to draw correlations between their budgets and the student population of each region.

                                    Apart from the 9400 public schools, DepEd has also allocated billions towards its regional offices. However a large chunk of 148,777,641,000 pesos was allocated to the Central Office. This budget alone dwarfs most other executive departments. This budget is primarily allocated to building new schools, the Senior High School Voucher Program, Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Program for Private Junior High School, textbooks and other instructional materials, the School-Based Feeding Program (SBFP) and the Computerization Program. The budget does not provide specific details as to how or where these funds for each program or school building are allocated. Hence it would prove to be hard to affiliate the budget of the Central Office to any region, therefore despite its large amount, it would be disregarded in this study.

These would be added together to represent the budget of each region for the DHSUD. Notably in 2020 however, the budget for the DHSUD was not split per region but for groups of regions such as Central Visayas Region (Regions VII and VIII), and Northern Luzon Region (CAR, Regions I and II). Due to this weird budgeting during 2020, the budgets in 2020 could be split amongst each region appropriately based on what we think is appropriate, or the budgets of 2021-2024 could be aggregated to the groupings created in 2020. Further consultation is needed to determine the approach to take.

The budget does not provide specific details as to how much of this pay/salary is allocated per region, rather each region has allocated budgets primarily for fuel, oil, materials, electricity and funds to construct new police stations. If data is found for the number of police personnel per region, then the Central Office’s budget could be considered, but for now it is disregarded.

Around 92 billion pesos is also allocated to a mix of Public Health Emergency Benefits and Allowances, the National Health Workforce Support System (NHWSS), the Health Facilities Enhancement  Program and the Cancer Assistance Fund. The DOH does not release information about how much of this money goes to which people or what hospitals or regions. Hence it is quite hard to group these allocations regionally, which means it cannot really be used for this study.

Most notably this includes New Bilibid Prison with a 6,033,975,000 peso budget.

It also weirdly has allocations for regions, which are not the same as the regional offices. These will all be added together for each region.

                                    The DOTr's Central Office unlike the other departments does provide some more specific details on how it spends its money. Some notable expenses are subsidies for the MRT and LRT and some other for airports and ports. These expenses will be added to the respective regions they are generally located in. The other expenses however such as sea operations and motor vehicle registration will not be considered.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">Department of Public Works and Highways</span> has District Engineering Offices all across the country. These range from being within cities to provincial. They can be grouped into around 95 data entries with corresponding budgets and populations. They also handle regional offices which could be divided to their respective provinces or the provinces could all be added to their corresponding regions. Further consultation will decide this approach.

                                    Their Central Office has a big budget and is very detailed in its expenses unlike other executive departments. The expenses are typically for large construction projects such as the Davao City Bypass or expressways. Given this long list of expenses, we can group each of the Central Office's expenses into their corresponding provinces or regions. We can do this by inputting the list of Central Office expenses to a program which would find the location of each construction project by comparing the text with a list of locations or through AI. Other expenses would be disregarded.

                                    The Department of Social Work and Development have regional offices and their respective budgets. We could ignore the Central Office's huge budget as it is mostly concentrated in big national programs like AKAP, Protective Services, Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, etc. We cannot really find out how these programs allocate their spendings regionally so we could just ignore them as they are national programs.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">Department of Trade and Industry</span> has regional offices and extension offices across the country.

The Central Office's budget is focused more on subsidies, and support to NGOs, as such it will be ignored for this study.

                                    The <span class="emph text-primary">National Economic and Development Authority</span> has regional offices, region development councils, and regional statistical services offices. The budgets of each of these will be added together to their respective regions. The Central Office’s budget of NEDA will be ignored as it is mostly focused on the Philippine Statistics Authority and their expenses for censuses and the Philippine Identification System. These services are typically for the entire nation and hence cannot be regionalized.
